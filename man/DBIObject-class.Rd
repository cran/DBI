\title{DBIObject class.}
\description{
Base class for all other DBI classes (e.g., drivers, connections). This
is a virtual Class: No objects may be created from it.
}
\details{
More generally, the DBI defines a very small set of classes and methods that
allows users and applications access DBMS with a common interface.  The
virtual classes are \code{DBIDriver} that individual drivers extend,
\code{DBIConnection} that represent instances of DBMS connections, and
\code{DBIResult} that represent the result of a DBMS statement.  These three
classes extend the basic class of \code{DBIObject}, which serves as the root
or parent of the class hierarchy.

\section{Implementation notes}{

An implementation MUST provide methods for the following generics:

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{dbGetInfo}}.
}

It MAY also provide methods for:

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{summary}}. Print a concise description of the
    object. The default method invokes \code{dbGetInfo(dbObj)} and prints
    the name-value pairs one per line.  Individual implementations may
    tailor this appropriately.
}

\dontrun{
drv <- dbDriver("MySQL")

res <- dbSendQuery(con, "select * from vitalSuite")
is(drv, "DBIObject")   ## True
is(con, "DBIObject")   ## True
is(res, "DBIObject")
