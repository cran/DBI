Version 0.2-5

* Code cleanups contributed by Matthias Burger: avoid partial argument
  name matching and use TRUE/FALSE, not T/F.

* Change behavior of make.db.names.default to quote SQL keywords if
  allow.keywords is FALSE.  Previously, SQL keywords would be name
  mangled with underscores and a digit.  Now they are quoted using
  '"'.

Version 0.2-4

* Changed license from GPL to LPGL

* Fixed a trivial typo in documentation

Version 0.1-10

* Fixed documentation typos.

Version 0.1-9

* Trivial changes.

Version 0.1-8

* A trivial change due to package.description() being deprecated in 1.9.0.

Version 0.1-7

* Had to do a substantial re-formatting of the documentation
  due to incompatibilities introduced in 1.8.0 S4 method
  documentation. The contents were not changed (modulo fixing 
  a few typos).  Thanks to Kurt Hornik and John Chambers for
  their help.

Version 0.1-6

* Trivial documentation changes (for R CMD check's sake)

Version 0.1-5

* Removed duplicated setGeneric("dbSetDataMappings") 

Version 0.1-4

* Removed the "valueClass" from some generic functions, namely,
  dbListConnections, dbListResults, dbGetException, dbGetQuery,
  and dbGetInfo.  The reason is that methods for these generics
  could potentially return different classes of objects (e.g., 
  the call dbGetInfo(res) could return a list of name-value pairs,
  while dbGetInfo(res, "statement") could be a character vector).

* Added 00Index to inst/doc

* Added dbGetDBIVersion() (simple wrapper to package.description).

Version 0.1-3

* ??? Minor changes?

Version 0.1-2

* An implementation based on version 4 classes and methods.
* Incorporated (mostly Tim Keitt's) comments.
