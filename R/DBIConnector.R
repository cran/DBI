#' DBIConnector class
#'
#' Wraps objects of the [DBIDriver-class] class to include connection options.
#' The purpose of this class is to store both the driver
#' and the connection options.
#' A database connection can be established
#' with a call to [dbConnect()], passing only that object
#' without additional arguments.
#'
#' To prevent leakage of passwords and other credentials,
#' this class supports delayed evaluation.
#' All arguments can optionally be a function (callable without arguments).
#' In such a case, the function is evaluated transparently when connecting in
#' [dbGetConnectArgs()].
#'
# FIXME: Include this
# Database backends can take advantage of this feature by returning an
# instance of this class instead of `DBIDriver`.
# See the implementation of [RSQLite::SQLite()]  for an example.
